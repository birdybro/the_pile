# Valkyrie Profile Best Playthrough Experience Guide (Spoiler-Free)

Valkyrie Profile has 3 endings. C, B, and A. C is basically game over. B is "meh". And A is the "true" ending with lots of character development and pretty much the only way to play the game. Valkyrie Profile is practically a perfect game if it were not for them hiding the A Ending. This guide will hopefully help you get the A ending easily in as spoiler-free of a way possible. You can get the A ending on Normal and Hard mode, but I really suggest getting going through the game on Hard mode since Normal is just too easy.

Valkyrie profile has sacred phases at the end of each chapter. So it goes like this:

```
Chapter 0
Chapter 1
Sacred Phase 1-2
Chapter 2
Sacred Phase 2-3
etc...
```

Sometimes you have to do things before the end of a chapter for this guide so pay attention. Print this guide out preferably so you can mark the check boxes to keep track of where you are.

## Tips

When you send up Einherjar, max out their hero value, give them basic equipment from that chapter, level up the abilities that correlate to the instructions Freya gave you in the Sacred Phase earlier, and give them cheap accessories that you transmutate. Better sends gets you better rewards, which can help a lot in Hard mode (which you should be playing because you aren't a weak whiny loser like someone named "Llewelyn").

Every chapter just use spiritual concentrations until it doesn't give you any location to go to anymore, then go get the characters, and then do the dungeons.

Caves of oblivion are like bonus levels with a randomized path each time you enter them. Save up tomes of alchemy (can also be made by transmutating Ether Scepters and Element Scepters) and use them on the too-tough-to-beat monsters in these caves for lots of EXP.

Often times, in the towns you recruited Einherjar from, if you return to those places with them still not sent to Valhalla yet, they will have a little cutscene and you will get a cool item.

Make a different save in the beginning of every chapter, you might mess up and need to go back, trust me... It will save your ass.

## Goals

* Lower Valkyrie's Seal Value to 37 or lower before the end of Chapter 6 (before Sacred Phase 6-7). (SEAL VALUE IS NOT THE SAME AS EVALUATION! Seal value is in the status menu!)
* Keep Estimated Worth above 40 throughout the game.
* Complete the Tower of Lezard Valeth before the end of Chapter 4.
* Recruit Lucian and Mystina in Chapter 5.
* Send Lucian to Valhalla in Chapter 5 or 6.

## What affects the Seal Value?

## The Steps!

⬜️ Start game on ~~Normal~~ (weak/lame/dumb) or -->_**Hard**_<-- (awesome/cool-person) mode.

⬜️ Chapter 1 - Before Sacred Phase 1-2 (end of Chapter 1), send up Llewelyn, the weak and whiny loser who's name is weird, and just play the game normally. If you send up Llewelyn in any other chapter, he sucks so bad that he dies instantly cuz he's dumb and weak, so don't do it. God he's so weak.

⬜️ Chapter 2 - Before Sacred Phase 2-3 (end of Chapter 2), send up both Lawfer and Jun, and just play the game normally.

⬜️ Chapter 3 - Go to Brahms castle but DO NOT FACE BRAHMS, DO NOT MEET HIM YET!! IT WILL RUIN THE A ENDING!! He is past the 2nd save point, so don't go past that! This castle has lots of goodies, make sure you get the Unicorn Horn from here, it's an AWESOME staff that will make your wizard kick ASS! It has a time limit so it's not super easy to get everything. If the time runs out you just get kicked out of the castle so don't sweat it too much. You will come back here next chapter to actually face Brahms so it's best to pick up all the items now.

⬜️ Still Chapter 3 - Before Sacred Phase 3-4 (end of Chapter 3), send up Janus (Archer) if you have him, if you have no Archer send up Belenus/Jun/Lawfer, it's fine.

⬜️ Chapter 4 - At the **beginning of the chapter**, send up Nanami if you have her with the Angel Lips accessory. Send up Jelanda too to ensure your Seal Value gets as high as possible.

⬜️ Still Chapter 4 - Recruit every character (**except the one in Flenceburg**) from your spiritual concentrations.

⬜️ Still Chapter 4 - Beat all of the dungeons in this chapter (**except Flenceburg, except Brahms's castle**)

⬜️ Still Chapter 4 - Go to Flenceburg and recruit Lorenta and then beat the Tower of Lezard Valeth (very hard, that's why I had you do other dungeons first). (-15 Seal)

⬜️ Still Chapter 4 - Visit the Weeping Lily Meadow. (-15 Seal)

⬜️ Still Chapter 4 - Visit Gerabellum (-15 Seal)

⬜️ Still Chapter 4 - Go to Brahms's castle, go find him, and then choose not to fight him. (-10 Seal)

⬜️ Still Chapter 4 - Remove the Nibelungen Ring from Valkyrie before the Sacred Phase (end of chapter 4) (-2 Seal)

⬜️ Chapter 5 - Do spiritual concentrations to get Lucian and Mystina and all the other characters.

⬜️ Still Chapter 5 - Beat the dungeons.

⬜️ Still Chapter 5 - Send up Yumei.

⬜️ Still Chapter 5 - Remove the Nibelungen Ring from Valkyrie before the Sacred Phase (end of chapter 5) (-2 Seal)

⬜️ Chapter 6 - Spiritual concentrations, recruit everyone, and finish all dungeons.

⬜️ Still Chapter 6 - Send up Lucian, watch the cool cutscene.

⬜️ Still Chapter 6 - If you can keep your seal value UNDER 37 (36 or less) feel free to send up Lorenta, otherwise do NOT go over 36!!!

⬜️ Chapter 7 - A big set of cutscenes happen at the start of Chapter 7 **IF** you did everything right! If not, load your save at the start of Chapter 6 or Chapter 5 and fix it! :P

⬜️ Still Chapter 7 - Spiritual Concentration, recruit peoples, dungeons, and send up Lyseria and someone else.

⬜️ Chapter 8 - Spiritual Concentrations, **avoid the Weeping Lily Meadow until you want to head to the end of the game, it ends the game!**. Recruit peoples, do dungeons, send up your two highest hero value heroes you can...

⬜️ Still Chapter 8 - After everything is done, head to the Weeping Lily Meadow to complete the game. This is a long series of stuff with only a couple saves in between, it's epic, you got some hard fights, you will need the Guts ability for a couple of them, Auto-Item too probably. Use your best characters, give them your best gear, and use all of your Exp Orb points on your best characters!

⬜️ The Epic A Ending - totally epic bruh...

## Sacred Phase Requirements

Just in case you forgot them or forgot to write them down for each chapter. I list off the skills wanted, and the type of Einherjar that Freya describes to you.

⬜️ Chapter 1 - No requirements. (Just send up Llewelyn cuz he's a weak and whiny loser and his name is weird)

⬜️ Chapter 2 - Tactics, Leadership, Identify. A Warrior. (Send up Belenus/Jun/Lawfer)

⬜️ Chapter 3 - Find Trap, Survival. Archer. (Send up Janus and Belenus/Jun/Lawfer)

⬜️ Chapter 4 - Trick, Demon Int, Hear Noise. A Negotiator. (send up Nanami and Jelanda at the start)

⬜️ Chapter 5 - March, Attack Pow, Resist Damage, Defend. A Nimble Person who can Swim and a Swordsman (Yumei and Lucian).

⬜️ Chapter 6 - Brave, Monster Int, Hit. A Sorceror and a Swordsman (Send Lucian and Lorenta)

⬜️ Chapter 7 - Undead Int, Avoid, Resist Magic. A High Level Sorceror (Lyseria and someone else).

⬜️ Chapter 8 - March, Fight, Counter, Leadership, Formation. Strong Einherjar with a high Hero Value. (send up your highest 2 hero value heroes, doesn't matter)


## Relics To Keep!

These are the relics you should keep at the end of the dungeons. They are in fancy treasure chests after the final boss of the dungeon is defeated. Some of these are critical later on if you want to do end-game item creation for fun. Some are just really useful and powerful when you get them. I'm only going to go over the ones in Hard mode because you shouldn't play Normal because only *Llewelyn's* play Normal mode.
